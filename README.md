# Overview

This app tracks the weapons and personnel of a small military organization. It has a built-in messaging system and allows commanders to view personnel under their command. Allows users to view their own service record.

I wanted to create a basic web app that would allow me to practice with database integration, user profiles, dynamic React pages, and levels of security and authorization.

To start the development server, run the command "npm run dev" and navigate to this link: http://localhost:3000/dashboard

# Web Pages

The Home page should be relatively empty for the time being. It serves primarily as a menu for other pages. Transitions between pages are accomplished with the built-in React Link component.

The Directory page allows the user to interact with the personnel table within the database. Incorporates basic SQL to search and display filtered results.

The Arsenal page allows the user to interact with the various arsenal tables of the database. Incorporates basic SQL to search and display filtered results.
